# Sentiment Analysis of Virgin Airline Tweets

This sentiment analysis project aimed to analyze 14,000 tweets related to Virgin Airlines using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The goal was to classify the tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, and determine the overall sentiment towards Virgin Airlines.

The analysis revealed that 60% of the analyzed tweets were negative, indicating a significant level of customer dissatisfaction with Virgin Airlines' services. This finding highlights the importance of addressing these concerns and improving the customer experience.

To prepare the data for analysis, a cleaning and preprocessing step was performed. This involved removing stop words, special characters, hashtags, and tokenizing the text to ensure accurate classification.

Several classification algorithms were applied to train the model and determine the best-performing approach. Among the tested algorithms, logistic regression demonstrated superior performance with an accuracy rate of 85%. Logistic regression proved to be the most effective method for accurately categorizing tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories.

The results of this sentiment analysis project provide valuable insights into the sentiment of Virgin Airlines' customers. By identifying the predominant negative sentiment, the airline can focus on addressing specific issues and implementing improvements to enhance customer satisfaction.
